# hello-world
My first reposoitory.

I've actually lied, this is not my first repository.
I work as a software developer in a german company that builds all types of products 
for the automotive industry.

I decided to create this repo anyway to honor the good-old-fashioned "hello world"
tradition in programming just because this is actually the first repo I create on
my personal account.

So... Hello world!

:)
